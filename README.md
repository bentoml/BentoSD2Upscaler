This project demonstrates how to build an image generation application with upscaling ability using BentoML, powered by [diffusers](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers).

## Prerequisites

- You have installed Python 3.8+ and `pip`. See the [Python downloads page](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to learn more.
- You have a basic understanding of key concepts in BentoML, such as Services. We recommend you read [Quickstart](https://docs.bentoml.com/en/1.2/get-started/quickstart.html) first.
- If you want to test this Service locally, we highly recommend using a Nvidia GPU with more than 16G VRAM.
- (Optional) We recommend you create a virtual environment for dependency isolation for this project. See the [Conda documentation](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) or the [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) for details.

## Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run the BentoML Service

We have defined a BentoML Service in `service.py`. Run `bentoml serve` in your project directory to start the Service.

```bash
$ bentoml serve .

2024-01-19T06:16:28+0800 [INFO] [cli] Starting production HTTP BentoServer from "service:SD2Service" listening on http://localhost:3000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
Loading pipeline components...: 100%
```

The server is now active at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/). You can interact with it using the Swagger UI or in other different ways.

CURL

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://localhost:3000/txt2img' \
  -H 'accept: image/*' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "prompt": "photo of a majestic sunrise in the mountains, best quality, 4k",
  "negative_prompt": "low quality, bad quality, sketches",
  "height": 320,
  "width": 320,
  "num_inference_steps": 50,
  "guidance_scale": 7.5,
  "upscale": true
}'
```

## Deploy to production

After the Service is ready, you can deploy the application to BentoCloud for better management and scalability. A configuration YAML file (`bentofile.yaml`) is used to define the build options for your application and package your application into a Bento. See [Bento build options](https://docs.bentoml.com/en/latest/concepts/bento.html#bento-build-options) to learn more.

Make sure you have [logged in to BentoCloud](https://docs.bentoml.com/en/1.2/bentocloud/how-tos/manage-access-token.html), then run the following command in your project directory to deploy the application to BentoCloud.

```bash
bentoml deploy .
```

Once the application is up and running on BentoCloud, you can access it via the exposed URL.

**Note**: Alternatively, you can use BentoML to generate a [Docker image](https://docs.bentoml.com/en/1.2/guides/containerization.html) for a custom deployment.
